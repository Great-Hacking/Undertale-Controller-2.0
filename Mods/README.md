# How To Make Mods
1) Create a new folder. Name it whatever you want, I will call mines "example"
2) Inside that folder, make a new file called "mod.json"
3) Then create a new file called "mod.js" or anything of your choice, it must have a .js at the end
4) Inside of the mod.json file enter:
```json
{
	"script": "mod.js",
	"author": "Author Here",
	"description": "Description"
}
```
5) Inside the mod.js file, I'll type:
```js
console.log("Hello World!");
```
6) Go to the Undertale Controller DIR and go to the mods folder, inside of the add the folder where your mod contents are, my folder is called example
8) Start Undertale Controller and enter "mod", type the name of your folder and the mod will load
9) If your mod comes up with an error, make sure you do every step correctly.
